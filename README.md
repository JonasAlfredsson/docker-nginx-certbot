# docker-nginx-certbot

Automatically create and renew website SSL certificates using the Let's Encrypt
free certificate authority and its client *certbot*. Built on top of the Nginx
server running on Debian. OpenSSL is used to automatically create the
Diffie-Hellman parameters used during the initial handshake of some ciphers.

> :information_source: The very first time this container is started it might
  take a long time before before it is ready to respond to requests. Read more
  about this in the [Diffie-Hellman parameters](#diffie-hellman-parameters)
  section.



# Acknowledgments and Thanks

This container requests SSL certificates from [Let's Encrypt][1], with the help
of their [*certbot*][2] script, which they provide for the absolutely bargain
price of free! If you like what they do, please [donate][3].

This repository was originally forked from [`@henridwyer`][4] by
[`@staticfloat`][5], before it was forked again by me. However, the changes to
the code has since become so significant that this has now been detached as its
own independent repository (while still retaining all the history). Migration
instructions, from `@staticfloat`'s image, can be found
[here](#help-migrating-from-staticfloats-image).

Some of the more significant additions to this container:

- Handles multiple server names when
  [requesting certificates](#how-the-script-add-domain-names-to-certificate-requests)
  (i.e. both `example.com` and `www.example.com`).
- Will create [Diffie-Hellman parameters](#diffie-hellman-parameters) if they
  are defined.
- Uses the [parent container][27]'s [`/docker-entrypoint.d/`][16] folder.
- Will report correct [exit code][14] when stopped/killed/failed.
- Stricter when it comes to checking that all files exist.
- Easily to [force renewal](#manualforce-renewal) of certificates if necessary.
- You can tune your own [renewal interval](#renewal-check-interval).
- Builds for multiple architectures available on [Docker Hub][20].



# Usage

## Before You Start
1. This guide expects you to already own a domain which points at the correct
   IP address, and that you have both port `80` and `443` correctly forwarded if
   you are behind NAT.
   Otherwise I recommend [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) as a Dynamic DNS
   provider, and then either search on how to port forward on your router or
   maybe find it [here](https://portforward.com/router.htm).

2. Tips on how to make a proper server config file, and how to create a simple
   test, can be found under the [Good to Know](#good-to-know) section.

3. I don't think it is necessary to mention if you managed to find this
   repository, however, I have been proven wrong before so I want to make it
   clear that this is a Dockerfile which requires
   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to function.


## Available Environment Variables

### Required
- `CERTBOT_EMAIL`: Your e-mail address. Used by Let's Encrypt to contact you in
                   case of security issues.

### Optional
- `STAGING`: Set to `1` to use Let's Encrypt's
             [staging servers](#initial-testing) (default: `0`)
- `DHPARAM_SIZE`: The size of the
                  [Diffie-Hellman parameters](#diffie-hellman-parameters)
                  (default: `2048`)
- `RSA_KEY_SIZE`: The size of the RSA encryption keys (default: `2048`)
- `RENEWAL_INTERVAL`: Time interval between certbot's
                      [renewal checks](#renewal-check-interval) (default: `8d`)


## Volumes
- `/etc/letsencrypt`: Stores the obtained certificates and the Diffie-Hellman
                      parameters
- `/etc/nginx_conf`:  For providing server configuration files at the time of
                      starting the container


## Run with `docker run`

### Build it yourself...
This option is for if you have downloaded this entire repository.

Place any additional server configuration you desire inside the
[`nginx_conf.d/`](./src/nginx_conf.d) folder and run the following command in
your terminal while residing inside the [`src/`](./src) folder.

```bash
docker build --tag jonasal/nginx-certbot:local .
```

### ...or get it from Docker Hub
This option is for if you make your own `Dockerfile`.

This image exist on Docker Hub under [`jonasal/nginx-certbot`][20], which means
you can make your own `Dockerfile` for a cleaner folder structure. Just add a
command where you copy in your own server configuration files (make sure
that none of your files replace those already present).

```Dockerfile
FROM jonasal/nginx-certbot:latest
COPY conf.d/* /etc/nginx/conf.d/
```

Don't forget to build it!

```bash
docker build --tag jonasal/nginx-certbot:local .
```

### The `run` Command
Irregardless what option you chose above you run it with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
           --env CERTBOT_EMAIL=your@email.org \
           -v $(pwd)/nginx_secrets:/etc/letsencrypt \
           --name nginx-certbot jonasal/nginx-certbot:local
```

> You should be able to detach from the container by holding `Ctrl` and pressing
  `p` + `q` after each other.


## Run with `docker-compose`
An example of a `docker-compose.yaml` file can be found in the
[`examples/`](./examples) folder. The default parameters that are found inside
the `nginx-certbot.env` file will be overwritten by any environment variables
you set inside the `.yaml` file.

Move the `.yaml` file (and optionally the `.env` file) into the [`src/`](./src)
folder, and then build and start with the following commands. Just remember to
place any additional server configs you want inside the
[`nginx_conf.d/`](./src/nginx_conf.d) folder beforehand.

```bash
docker-compose build --pull
docker-compose up
```



# Good to Know

## Initial Testing
In case you are just experimenting with setting this up I suggest you set the
environment variable `STAGING=1`, since this will change the challenge URL to
the staging one. This will not give you "*proper*" certificates, but it has
ridiculous high [rate limits][6] compared to the non-staging
[production certificates][7].

Include it like this:
```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
           --env CERTBOT_EMAIL=your@email.org \
           --env STAGING=1 \
           --name nginx-certbot jonasal/nginx-certbot:latest
```

## Creating a Server `.conf` File
As an example of a barebone (but functional) SSL server in Nginx you can
look at the file `example_server.conf` inside the [`examples/`](./examples)
directory. By replacing '`yourdomain.org`' with your own domain you can
actually use this config to quickly test if things are working properly.

Place the modified config inside the [`nginx_conf.d/`](./src/nginx_conf.d)
folder, `build` the container and then run it as described [above](#usage).
Let the container do it's [magic](#diffie-hellman-parameters) for a while, and
then try to visit your domain. You should now be greeted with the string \
"`Let's Encrypt certificate successfully installed!`".

## How the Script add Domain Names to Certificate Requests
The included script will go through all configuration files (`*.conf*`) it
finds inside Nginx's `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` folder, and create requests from the
file's content. In every unique file it will find any line that says:

```
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.org/privkey.pem;
```

and only extract the part which here says "`yourdomain.org`", and this will
henceforth be used as the "primary domain" for this config file. It will then
find all the lines that contain `server_name` and make a list of all the domain
names that exist on the same line. So a file containing something like this:

```
server {
    listen              443 ssl;
    server_name         yourdomain.org www.yourdomain.org;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.org/privkey.pem;
    ...
}

server {
    listen              443 ssl;
    server_name         sub.yourdomain.org;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.org/privkey.pem;
    ...
}
```

will share the same certificate file (the "primary domain"), but the certbot
command will include all listed domain variants. The limitation is that you
should write all your server blocks that have the same "primary domain" in the
same file. The certificate request from the above file will then become
something like this (duplicates will be removed):

```
certbot ... -d yourdomain.org -d www.yourdomain.org -d sub.yourdomain.org
```

## Renewal Check Interval
This container will automatically start a certbot certificate renewal check
after the time duration that is defined in the environmental variable
`RENEWAL_INTERVAL` has passed. After certbot has done its stuff, the code will
return and wait the defined time before triggering again.

This process is very simple, and is just a `while [ true ];` loop with a `sleep`
at the end:

```bash
while [ true ]; do
    # Run certbot...
    sleep "$RENEWAL_INTERVAL"
done
```

So when setting the environmental variable, it is possible to use any string
that is recognized by `sleep`, e.g. `3600` or `60m` or `1h`. Read more about
which values that are allowed in its [manual][8].

The default is `8d`, since this allows for multiple retries per month, while
keeping the output in the logs at a very low level. If nothing needs to be
renewed certbot won't do anything, so it should be no problem setting it lower
if you want to. The only thing to think about is to not to make it longer than
one month, because then you would [miss the window][9] where certbot would deem
it necessary to update the certificates.

## Diffie-Hellman Parameters
Regarding the Diffie-Hellman parameter it is recommended that you have one for
your server, and in Nginx you define it by including a line that starts with
`ssl_dhparam` in the server block (see
[`examples/example_server.conf`](./src/nginx_conf.d)). However, you can make a
config file without it and Nginx will work just fine with ciphers that don't
rely on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange ([more info about ciphers][10]).

The larger you make these parameters the longer it will take to generate them.
I was unlucky and it took me 65 minutes to generate a 4096 bit parameter on an
old 3.0GHz CPU. This will vary **greatly** between runs as some randomness is
involved. A 2048 bit parameter, which is still secure today, can probably be
calculated in about 1-3 minutes on a modern CPU (this process will only have to
be done once, since one of these parameters is good for the rest of your
website's lifetime). To modify the size of the parameter you may set the
`DHPARAM_SIZE` environment variable. Default is `2048` if nothing is provided.

It is also possible to have **all** your server configs point to **the same**
Diffie-Hellman parameter on disk. There is no negative effects in doing this for
home use ([source 1][11] & [source 2][12]). For persistence you should place it
inside the dedicated folder `/etc/letsencrypt/dhparams/`, which is inside the
predefined Docker [volume](#volumes). There is, however, no requirement to do
so, since a missing parameter will be created where the config file expects the
file to be. But this would mean that the script will have to re-create these
every time you restart the container, which may become a little bit tedious.

You can also create this file on a completely different (faster?) computer and
just mount/copy the created file into this container. This is perfectly fine,
since it is nothing "private/personal" about this file. The only thing to
think about in that case would perhaps be to use a folder that is not under
`/etc/letsencrypt/`, since that would otherwise cause a double mount.

## Manual/Force Renewal
It might be of interest to manually trigger a renewal of the certificates, and
that is why the `run_certbot.sh` script is possible to run standalone at any
time from within the container.

However, the preferred way of requesting a reload of all the configuration files
is to send in a `SIGHUP` to the container:

```bash
docker kill --signal=HUP <container_name>
```

This will terminate the [sleep timer](#renewal-check-interval) and make the
renewal loop start again from the beginning.

While this will be enough in the majority of the cases, it might sometimes be
necessary to **force** a renewal of the certificates even though certbot thinks
it could keep them for a while longer (like when [this][13] happened). It is
therefore possible to add "force" as an argument, when calling the
`run_certbot.sh` script, to have it append the `--force-renewal` flag to the
requests made.

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> /scripts/run_certbot.sh force
```

This will request new certificates irregardless of then they are set to expire.

> NOTE: Using "force" will make new requests for **all** you certificates, so
        don't run it too often since there are some limits to requesting
        [production certificates][7].


## Help Migrating from `@staticfloat`'s Image
The two images are not that different when it comes to building/running, since
this repository was originally a fork. So just like in `@staticfloat`'s setup
you need to get your own `*.conf` files into the container's
`/etc/nginx/conf.d/` folder, and then you should be able to start this one
just like you did with his.

This can either be done by copying your own files into the container at
[build time](#run-with-docker-run), or you can mount a local folder to the
aforementioned location. In the latter case you need to make sure you include
the two files present in this repository's
[`src/nginx_conf.d/`](./src/nginx_conf.d/) folder, since these are required in
order for certbot to request certificates.

Why you need to include these files yourself is because this gives the user more
freedom in how they can configure their server blocks, i.e. you can create
your own "redirector" if you do not like mine.

The only obligatory environment variable for starting this container is the
[`CERTBOT_EMAIL`](#required) one, just like in `@staticfloat`'s case, but I
have exposed a [couple of more](#optional) that can be changed from their
defaults if you like. Then there is of course any environment variables read by
the [parent container][27] as well, but those are probably not as important.

If you were using [templating][23] before, you should probably look into
["template" files][24] used by the Nginx parent container, since this is not
something I have personally implemented in mine.

  - This is done to facilitate a way to lock this container to a more specific
    version.
  - This also allows us to more often trigger rebuilds of this container on
    Docker Hub.
