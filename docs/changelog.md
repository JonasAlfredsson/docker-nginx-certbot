# Changelog

### 5.0.0
- We now run `nginx -t` before reloading Nginx. This will hopefully provide better info on
  config errors without crashing the container.
  - The reason for this being a major version is because technically we alter
    core container behavior where previous errors would result in a restart.
  - PR by [@stefansundin][48]

### 4.3.0
- Parent image is now using Python 3.11 which implements PEP 668, so we have
  to allow PIP to "break system packages".

### 4.2.1
- Require all certificate files to have a size greater than zero.

### 4.2.0
- Add Ionos DNS authenticator plugin
  - PR by [@mzbik][47].

### 4.1.0
- Install Bash 5.2.15 from [Debian Bookworm][44].
  - Workaround for [this Bash bug][46] which we also had in the [Alpine image][45].
  - Not using a "backport" repository is not recommended, but right now the only way.
- Added timestamps to the log output we produce.
  - This is *technically* a breaking change if someone parses our logs, but I will ignore that.

### 4.0.0
- New approach to [implementing IPv6 support][41] for the HTTP-01 challenge.
  - Deleted the dedicated server in [`certbot.conf`][43]
  - This change *should* be transparent for anyone not having a custom `certbot.conf` file, but is
    technically making a breaking change for *someone*, thus a major revision bump.

### 3.3.1
- Revert [previous feature][41] after it apparently breaking some setups.

### 3.3.0
- Have the server in [`certbot.conf`][42] listen on IPv6 as well.
  - PR by [@Meptl][41].

### 3.2.2
- Small syntax fixes recommended by shellcheck.
  - PR by [@ericstengard][40].

### 3.2.1
- Small syntax fixes recommended by shellcheck.
  - PR by [@ericstengard][39].

### 3.2.0
- Make it possible to override the `CERTBOT_PRODUCTION_URL` and `CERTBOT_STAGING_URL` variables.
  - You can now point certbot to whichever ACME server you want.

### 3.1.3
- Recover and retry in case of failed `dhparam` creation.
  - PR by [@staticfloat][38].

### 3.1.2
- Use latest version of Bash in the Alpine image again.
  - The `wait` bug is [fixed][37] since Bash 5.1.10.

### 3.1.1
- Small [bugfix][14] for the `dns-route53` authenticator.
- Made so it is only bash that is installed from an older Alpine repository.
  - PR by [@dtcooper][36].

### 3.1.0
- Replace `sort -u` with `awk '!a[$0]++'` to keep distinct order of the domain names.
  - PR by [@dtcooper][35].

### 3.0.1
- Actually use ECDSA certificates by default.
  - Eagerness to deploy latest version this update was forgotten.

### 3.0.0
- Add support for DNS-01 challenges.
  - Check out the list of all currently [supported authenticators](./certbot_authenticators.md).
  - This also means it is now possible to request wildcard certificates!
  - PR by [@XaF][32].
- Make it possible to define which authenticator to use on a certificate basis.
  - Like with [ECDSA/RSA](./advanced_usage.md#multi-certificate-setup), you can
    [add the authenicator's name](./certbot_authenticators.md#using-a-dns-01-authenticator-for-specific-certificates-only)
    in the `cert_name` to override the default.
  - PR by [@XaF][32].
- Make it possible to use same `cert_name` across multiple config files.
  - The scripts will remember all domain names associated with the cert name.
  - This means you can now use as many config files as you want and have them all point to a single certificate.
- Add [BATS][34].
  - A lot unit tests for the Bash functions we use in the [`util.sh`](../src/scripts/util.sh) file.
  - Also add it as a [GitHub action](../.github/workflows/unit_tests.yml).
  - A huge thank you to [@XaF][33] for providing the foundation for this.
- Add ability to override found `server_name`.
  - By adding a comment on the `server_name` line the script will now use [that instead](./advanced_usage.md#override-server_name).
  - This enables you to easily group domains under a common wildcard certificate ([example config](../examples/example_server_overrides.conf)).
- Any server name beginning with '`~`' will be ignored.
  - This character means that the server name is a regex, and we cannot use it when requesting certificates.
- Use [ECDSA](./good_to_know.md#ecdsa-and-rsa-certificates) certificates by default.
  - You now have to explicitly set `USE_ECDSA=0` to disable this.
- We aren't actually introducing any breaking changes, but such a large change deserves a major release.
- Update documentation.
- Update examples.


### 2.4.1
- Fix missing quotes around variable.
  - PR by [@LucianDavies][30].
- Changed package mirror used by Alpine images. More info in [issue #70][31].
- Added more documentation.
- Updated the `docker-compose` examples a bit.

### 2.4.0
- Create a script that can sign certificates with the help of a
  [local certificate authortiy](./advanced_usage#local-ca).
  - It is now possible to work completely offline.
  - We can now create certificates for `localhost`.
- Restructure and add a lot of documentation.
- `openssl` is now a symlink to `libressl` in the Alpine images.
  - This is done to simplify the rest of the scripts since the arguments are
    the same.

### 2.3.0
- Add support for [ECDSA][27] certificates.
  - It is possible to have Nginx serve both ECDSA and RSA certificates at the
    same time for the same server. Read more in its
    [good to know section](./good_to_know.md#ecdsa-and-rsa-certificates).
- Made so that the the "primary domain"/"cert name" can be
  [whatever](./good_to_know.md#how-the-script-add-domain-names-to-certificate-requests)
  you want.
  - This was actually already possible from [`v0.12`](#012), but it is first
    now we allow it.

### 2.2.0
- Listen to IPv6 in the [redirector.conf](../src/nginx_conf.d/redirector.conf)
  in addition to IPv4.
  - PR by [@staticfloat][25].
- Add `reuseport` in the [redirector.conf](../src/nginx_conf.d/redirector.conf),
  which improves latency and parallelization.
  - PR by [@staticfloat][26].
- Add mentions in the changelog to people who have helped with issues.

### 2.1.0
- Made the `create_dhparams.sh` script capable of creating missing directories.
  - Our small [`/docker-entrypoint.d/40-create-dhparam-folder.sh`][17] script
    is therefore no longer necessary.
- Made so that we run `symlink_user_configs` at startup so we do not run into
  a [race condition][16] with Nginx.
- Some minor cleanup in the Dockerfiles related to the above changes.

### 2.0.1
- There now exist a Dockerfile for building from the Nginx Alpine image as well.
  - It is possible to use the Alpine version by appending `-alpine` to any
    of the tags from now on.
  - There are now so many tags available, see
    [dockerhub_tags.md](./dockerhub_tags.md) for the possible combinations.
  - NOTE: There exists a bug in Bash 5.1.0, which is described in detail
    [here][15].
  - Suggested by [@tudddorrr][24].
- Small fix to the `create_dhparams.sh` script to handle the use of libressl
  in Alpine.
- Added a small sleep in order to mitigate a rare race condition between Nginx
  startup and the symlink script.
- Fix an ugly printout in the case when the sleep function exited naturally.

### 2.0.0
- Big change on how we recommend users to get their `.conf` files into the
  container.
  - Created a script that [creates symlinks][10] from `conf.d/` to the files
    in `user_conf.d/`.
  - Users can now [start the container](../README.md#run-with-docker-run)
    without having to build anything.
  - Still compatible with [the old way](../README.md#build-it-yourself), but I
    still think it's a "major" change.
  - Suggested by [@MauriceNino][23].
- Examples are updated to reflect changes.
- Add more logging.
- Add more `"` around variables for extra safety.
- Big overhaul of how the documentation is structured.
- Even more tags now available on Docker Hub!
  - See [dockerhub_tags.md](./dockerhub_tags.md) for the list.

### 1.3.0
- Ignore values starting with `data:` and `engine:` when verifying that all
  files exists.
  - PR by [@bblanchon][1].
- Add a debug mode which is enabled by setting the environment variable
  `DEBUG=1`.

### 1.2.0
- Fix dependencies so that it is possible to build in 32-bit ARM architectures.
  - Reported by [RtKelleher][11].
- Added [Dependabot][20] to monitor and update the Dockerfiles.
  - PR by [@odin568][19].
- Added [GitHub Actions/Workflows](../.github/workflows) so that each [tag][2]
  now is built for multiple arches ([issue #28][3]).

### 1.1.0
- Fix that scripts inside [`/docker-entrypoint.d/`][4] were never run
  ([issue #21][5]).
  - Found while helping [@isomerpages][21] move from @staticfloats image.
- Fix for issue where the script failed in case the `/etc/letsencrypt/dhparams`
  folder was missing.
  - Reported by [@pmkyl][6].

### 1.0.0
- Move over to [semantic versioning][7].
  - The version number will now be given like this: `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`
  - This is done to signify that I feel like this code is stable, since I have
    been running this for quite a while.
- Build from a defined version of Nginx.
  - This is done to facilitate a way to lock this container to a more specific
    version.
  - This also allows us to more often trigger rebuilds of this container on
    Docker Hub.
- New tags are available on [Docker Hub][2].
  - There will now be tags on the following form:
    - latest
    - 1.0.0
    - 1.0.0-nginx1.19.7

### 0.16
- Container now listens to [`SIGHUP`](./advanced_usage.md#manualforce-renewal)
  and will reload all configs if this signal is received.
  - More details can be found in the commit message: [bf2c135][13]
- Made Docker image slightly smaller by including `--no-install-recommends`.
- There is now also a [`dev` branch][9]/tag if you are brave and want to run
  experimental builds.
- [JonasAlfredsson/docker-nginx-certbot][22] is now its own independent
  repository (i.e. no longer just a fork).

### 0.15
- It is now possible to
  [manually trigger](./advanced_usage.md#manualforce-renewal) a renewal of
  certificates.
  - It is also possible to include "force" to add `--force-renewal` to the
    request.
- The "clean exit" trap now handle that parent container changed to
  [`SIGQUIT`][12] as stop signal.
- The "certbot" server block (in Nginx) now prints to stdout by default.
- Massive refactoring of both code and files:
  - Our "start **command**" file is now called `start_nginx_certbot.sh` instead
    of `entrypoint.sh`.
  - Both `create_dhparams.sh` and `run_certbot.sh` can now be run by themselves
    inside the container.
  - I have added `set -e` in most of the files so the program exit as intended
    when unexpected errors occurs.
  - Added `{}` and `""` around most of the bash variables.
  - Change some log messages and where they appear.
- Our `/scripts/startup/` folder has been removed.
  - The parent container will run any `*.sh` file found inside the
    [`/docker-entrypoint.d/`][4] folder.

### 0.14
- Made so that the container now exits gracefully and reports the correct exit
  code.
  - More details can be found in the commit message: [43dde6e][8]
- Bash script now correctly monitors **both** the Nginx and the certbot renewal
  process PIDs.
  - If either one of these processes dies, the container will exit with the same
    exit code as that process.
  - This will also trigger a graceful exit for the rest of the processes.
- Removed unnecessary and empty `ENTRYPOINT` from Dockerfile.
- A lot of refactoring of the code, cosmetic changes and editing of comments.

### 0.13
- Fixed the regex used in all of the `sed` commands.
  - Now makes sure that the proper amount of spaces are present in the right
    places.
  - Now allows comments at the end of the lines in the configs. `# Nice!`
  - Made the expression a little bit more readable thanks to the `-r` flag.
- Now made certbot solely responsible for checking if the certificates needs to
  be renewed.
  - Certbot is actually smart enough to not send any renewal requests if it
    doesn't have to.
- The time interval used to trigger the certbot renewal check is now user
  configurable.
  - The environment variable to use is `RENEWAL_INTERVAL`.

### 0.12
- Added `--cert-name` flag to the certbot certificate request command.
  - This allows for both adding and subtracting domains to the same certificate
    file.
  - Makes it possible to have path names that are not domain names (but this
    is not allowed yet).
- Made the file parsing functions smarter so they only find unique file paths.
- Cleaned up some log output.
- Updated the `docker-compose` example.
- Fixed some spelling in the documentation.

### 0.11
- Python 2 is EOL, so it's time to move over to Python 3.
- From now on [Docker Hub][2] will also automatically build with tags.
  - Lock the version by specifying the tag: `jonasal/nginx-certbot:0.11`

### 0.10
- Update to new ACME v2 servers.
  - PR by [@seaneshbaugh][18].

### 0.9
- I am now confident enough to remove the version suffixes.
- `nginx:mainline` is now using Debian 10 Buster.
- Updated documentation.

### 0.9-gamma
- Make both Nginx and the update script child processes of the `entrypoint.sh`
  script.
- Container will now die along with Nginx like it should.
- The Diffie-Hellman parameters now have better permissions.
- Container now exist on [Docker Hub][2] under `jonasal/nginx-certbot:latest`
- More documentation.

### 0.9-beta
- `@JonasAlfredsson` enters the battle.
- Diffie-Hellman parameters are now automatically generated.
- Nginx now handles everything HTTP related -> certbot set to webroot mode.
- Better checking to see if necessary files exist.
- Will now request a certificate that includes all domain variants listed
  on the `server_name` line.
- More extensive documentation.

### 0.8
- Ditch cron, it never liked me anyway.  Just use `sleep` and a `while`
  loop instead.

### 0.7
- Complete rewrite, build this image on top of the `nginx` image, and run
  `cron`/`certbot` alongside `nginx` so that we can have Nginx configs
  dynamically enabled as we get SSL certificates.

### 0.6
- Add `nginx_auto_enable.sh` script to `/etc/letsencrypt/` so that users can
  bring Nginx up before SSL certs are actually available.

### 0.5
- Change the name to `docker-certbot-cron`, update documentation, strip out
  even more stuff I don't care about.

### 0.4
- Rip out a bunch of stuff because `@staticfloat` is a monster, and likes to
  do things his way

### 0.3
- Add support for webroot mode.
- Run certbot once with all domains.

### 0.2
- Upgraded to use certbot client
- Changed image to use alpine linux

### 0.1
- Initial release
