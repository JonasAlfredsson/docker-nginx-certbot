# * No wildcard names. They are not supported by the authentication method used
#   in this script and will most likely fail by certbot.
# * Possble overlappings. This method will find all 'server_names' in a .conf 
#   file inside the conf.d/ folder and attach them to the request. If there are 
#   different primary domains in the same .conf file it will cause some weird 
#   certificates. Should however work fine but is not best practice.
